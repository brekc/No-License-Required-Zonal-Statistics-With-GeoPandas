# No License Required - Zonal Statistics With GeoPandas 

**Brek Chiles, 2025**

## Introduction

  GeoPandas is a geospatial Python library that combines Pandas and Shapely utilities to manipulate geometric and tabular data. Extending the default ArcGIS Python 3 environment with Esriâ€™s Deep Learning Libraries Installers or creating custom Python environments allows users to leverage GeoPandas and other open-source packages in their work. In this repository, I present Python code that builds a zonal statistics tool with GeoPandas and Rasterio. We will examine slope grades of main roadways in Central Redmond, WA, to apply the zonal statistics tool and explore the data analysis and manipulation capabilities of Geopandas. Rasterstats is another Python module offering a standalone zonal statistics tool. I used the zonal statistics tool from Rasterstats to compare results and validate the effectiveness of the GeoPandas-Rasterio zonal statistics tool. Modifying the input options between the GeoPandas-Rasterio and Rasterstats zonal statistics tools yields similar results for both tools. I also provide scripts with examples of implementing the GeoPandas-Rasterio zonal statistics tool with ArcPy and ArcGIS Pro. The repository covers a variety of GIS-Python concepts, and the material is intended for everyone, whether they are new to GIS and Python programming or experienced professionals looking to adopt open-source technologies into their workflows.
